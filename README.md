## Requirements

- The themes that you will be using.

## Installation
Use your preferred package manager to install crayons:

[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
return {
    "liamrlawrence/crayons.nvim",
    dependencies = {
        "liamrlawrence/cabinet.nvim",
        -- Themes go here
    },

    config = function()
        require("crayons").setup()
    end
}
```


## Configuration
The `crayons.nvim` setup function allows you to customize and extend the plugin according to your needs. Below are the configuration options available:

### Adding New Themes
You can add new themes or modify existing ones by including them in the `themes` table during setup. Each theme has several variants (standard, light, dark, darkest). Hereâ€™s how you can add a new theme:

```lua
require("crayons").setup({
    themes = {
        {   -- Theme #1
            name = "gruvbox",
            variants = {
                standard = "gruvbox-medium",
                light    = "gruvbox-light",
                dark     = "gruvbox-dark",
                darkest  = "gruvbox-dark",
            }
        },
        {   -- Theme #2
            name = "tokyonight",
            variants = {
                standard = "tokyonight-storm",
                light    = "tokyonight-day",
                dark     = "tokyonight-night",
                darkest  = "tokyonight-night",
            }
        },
        -- ...
    }
})
```

### Adding Special Themes
Special themes are ones that have a single variant and you want to assign unique settings, such as transparency and a specific keybindings. You can configure special themes in the `special_themes` section of the setup:

```lua
require("crayons").setup({
    special_themes = {
        {
            name = "vscode",             -- Theme name
            mode = "dark",               -- "dark" or "light"
            transparency = true,         -- true or false
            keybinding = "<leader>ttv",  -- custom binding
        },
        -- ...
    }
})
```

### Customizing Keybindings
Keybindings allow you to quickly switch between different theme variants. You can customize these keybindings in the `keybindings` field of the setup. Here's how to set up custom keybindings for switching themes:

```lua
require("crayons").setup({
    keybindings = {
        standard = "<leader>tt",
        light    = "<leader>tl",
        dark     = "<leader>td",
        darkest  = "<leader>tD"
    }
})
```

## Usage
### Switching Themes
You can use crayons.nvim to switch between themes and their variants through pre-configured keybindings:

-   **Standard Theme**: `<leader>tt#` - Switch to the standard variant of a theme, where `#` is the index number of the theme.
-   **Light Theme**: `<leader>tl#` - Switch to the light variant of a theme.
-   **Dark Theme**: `<leader>td#` - Switch to the dark variant of a theme.
-   **Darkest Theme with Transparency**: `<leader>tD#` - Switch to the darkest variant of a theme with transparency enabled.
